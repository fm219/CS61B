I began to take cs61b recently so I missed the deadline for submitting the assignments, but  I really love cs61b and prof. Josh hug. Even thought  I know it is too late
for the sp18 semester,  I decided the go through the whole videos and homeworks to strengthen my coding skills. I will follow the timeline and regulations of cs61b 
to show my respect to ucb and prof.Josh hug!!!!!
